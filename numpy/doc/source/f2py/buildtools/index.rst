F2PY and Build Systems
=======================

In this section we will cover the various popular build systems and their usage
with ``f2py``.

.. note::
   **As of November 2021**

   The default build system for ``F2PY`` has traditionally been the through the
   enhanced ``numpy.distutils`` module. This module is based on ``distutils`` which
   will be removed in ``Python 3.12.0`` in **October 2023**; ``setuptools`` does not
   have support for Fortran or ``F2PY`` and it is unclear if it will be supported
   in the future. Alternative methods are thus increasingly more important.


Basic Concepts
===============

Building an extension module which includes Python and Fortran consists of:

- Fortran source(s)
- One or more generated files from ``f2py``

  + A ``C`` wrapper file is always created
  + Code with modules require an additional ``.f90`` wrapper
  + Code with functions generate an additional ``.f`` wrapper

- ``fortranobject.{c,h}``

  + Distributed with ``numpy``
  + Can be queried via ``python -c "import numpy.f2py; print(numpy.f2py.get_include())"``

- NumPy headers

  + Can be queried via ``python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.get_include())"``

- Python libraries and development headers

Broadly speaking there are three cases which arise when considering the outputs of ``f2py``:

Fortran 77 programs
   - Input file ``blah.f``
   - Generates

     + ``blahmodule.c``
     + ``blah-f2pywrappers.f``

   When no ``COMMON`` blocks are present only a ``C`` wrapper file is generated.
   Wrappers are also generated to rewrite assumed shape arrays as automatic
   arrays.

Fortran 90 programs
   - Input file ``blah.f90``
   - Generates:

     + ``blahmodule.c``
     + ``blah-f2pywrappers.f``
     + ``blah-f2pywrappers2.f90``

   The ``f90`` wrapper is used to handle code which is subdivided into
   modules. The ``f`` wrapper makes ``subroutines`` for  ``functions``. It
   rewrites assumed shape arrays as automatic arrays.

Signature files
   - Input file ``blah.pyf``
   - Generates:

     + ``blahmodule.c``
     + ``blah-f2pywrappers2.f90`` (occasionally)
     + ``blah-f2pywrappers.f`` (occasionally)

   Signature files ``.pyf`` do not signal their language standard via the file
   extension, they may generate the F90 and F77 specific wrappers depending on
   their contents; which shifts the burden of checking for generated files onto
   the build system.

.. note::

   The signature file output situation is being reconsidered in `issue 20385`_ .


In theory keeping the above requirements in hand, any build system can be
adapted to generate ``f2py`` extension modules. Here we will cover a subset of
the more popular systems.

.. note::
   ``make`` has no place in a modern multi-language setup, and so is not
   discussed further.
