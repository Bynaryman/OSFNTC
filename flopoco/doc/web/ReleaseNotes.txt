Version 5.0-alpha0
Overhaul of the pipelining framework.
Overhaul of the BitHeap framework.
Removing all operators that have not been ported to these new framework, they will hopefully slowly trickle back.

======================================================================
Version 2.3.2
This is a maintenance release, it adds a missing header that prevented compilation on recent gcc.

======================================================================
Version 2.3.1
This is a bugfix release, mostly fixing a few multiplier bugs.

======================================================================
Version 2.3.0
This version adds
- Proper librarization, and an example on how to use FloPoCoLib
- LNS operators
- FPPowr and FPPow functions from C99
- FunctionTable (as the name suggests)
- FPConstMultRational, correctly rounded multiplication by small rational constants
- IntConstDiv, LUT-based Euclidean division by small integer constants
- FPConstDiv and FPConstDivExpert, an FP wrapper for the previous
- TaMaDi architecture, an example of a full application
- bug fixes and improvements
- new bugs so that we hear from you, our valued users

======================================================================
Version 2.2.1
This is a bugfix release. It corrects major bugs on some multipliers
not working on some Altera targets, and some minor bugs.

======================================================================
Version 2.2.0
The new version brings with it:
- FPPipeline assembles floating-point computational pipelines 
  from a C-like description (early alpha)
- a smaller (single path) architecture for floating-point addition
  (now the default architecture when calling FPAdd)
- 3-operand FPAdd
- KCM constant multipliers, including a FixRealKCM and FPRealKCM
- some bug-fixes
- plenty of other improvements of other operators, especially due to 
pipeline refinement 

======================================================================
Version 2.1.1
Identical to 2.1.0 except one small fix to enable compilation with latest mpfr

======================================================================
Version 2.1.0
Frequency-directed pipelining made easy. Operator latency scales much better
for lower frequencies. The two functions that do it all are: manageCriticalPath()
and setCriticalPath(). Most operators are already ported to this improved framework.
As a result, a global improvement can be remarked. 

- FPExp operator is completely new. It is a significant increment over any 
exponential operator currently available on the market.
- Truncated multipliers can now be signed
- FunctionEvaluator is improved by using truncated multipliers in the polynomial 
evaluation part.  
- FPLog pipeline is refined 
- FPPowr is introduced in experimental phase. 
- plenty of improvements of other operators, especially pipeline refinement 

======================================================================
Version 2.0.0
This version brings significant improvements to the framework:
- pipeline now made really easy: the C++ is now much easier to write
    and read, no longer need to insert use() everywhere
- improved support of Altera targets 
- added TestBenchFile, including exhaustive test
- much improved support of DSP blocks through Int*Multiplier operators
- UserDefinedOperator to bootstrap new users
There are few new operators, but they will boost future developments:
- FunctionEvaluator for high-precision fixed-point function evaluation
- MyIntAdder (name is temporary) for pipelined large additions
- IntTilingMultiplier, IntTruncMultipliers, IntKaratsubaMultiplier
    for DSP-efficient pipelined multipliers
- FPSqrtPoly, a polynomial version of the floating-point square root

======================================================================
Version 1.15.2
- fixes a bug in LargeAccToFP
- introduces autotools support thanks to Daniele Mastrandrea, 
    for people wanting to link to an autotools-based project
- introduces a Tobin Tax restriction in the license, 
    to prevent FloPoCo from participating in the next financial crisis.

======================================================================
Version 1.15.1 
- improves FPLog, which is now as good as we'll get for a while
- includes several new targets at various levels of completion. 
- introduces an integer compression tree, and improves 
   pipelined multipliers for these targets 

FloPoCo also now lives in its own namespace (thanks to Mariusz Grad),
which should help integrating it in larger project. 
Heaps of bugfixes, too.

======================================================================
Version 1.15.0 adds a Karatsuba multiplier (Virtex-only so far),
FPSquare, FPSQrt, Fix2FP, InputIEEE, and a lot of cleaning up and bug fixes.
With FPSqrt, we now have the 4 basic operations, so we proudly leave
the 0.xxx version numbers for 1.xxx, and drop FPLibrary for good.

======================================================================
Version 0.11.0 adds an IntSquarer, an FPDiv, and a rudimentary
pipeline to FPLog (work still in progress). It also adds Collision, an
example coarse-grain operator. From the developer point of view, this
version is the first with Pipeline Made Easy, the new framework for
cycle-based pipeline description.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.3 corrects a bug in FPAdd (adding zero was giving wrong
results). Thanks to A. Rolim for pointing it out.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.2 corrects bugs in FPConstMult and cleans up the pipeline
framework.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.1 vastly improves FPAdd, stabilizes FPLargeAcc, and sees an
invasion of Logarithm Number System operators developed by external
contributor Sylvain Collange.

Logarithm Number System is an alternative to Floating-Point
where multiplication and division are faster, cheaper and more
accurate while addition and subtraction are more expensive and less
accurate. It may be the right thing for your application.  

======================================================================
Version 0.8beta introduces FPLog and FPExp operators (currently not
pipelined) and LargeAccToFP. It improves automatic test bench
generation.  It also introduces the Altera Stratix II target.  It
improves pipelining of FPLargeAcc and FPMult, and introduces
pipelined version of IntConstMult (still buggy for some large
constants).  This is still a beta release, comments and bug reports
welcome.

======================================================================
Version 0.5beta adds the HOTBM operator 
and fixes bugs in the other operators.

It also introduces automatic testbench generation.

HOTBM is the Higher Order Table-Based Method for function evaluation.
With HOTBM support, FloPoCo is able to generate high-speed, low area
fixed-point implementations for a large class of real functions on
[0,1[.

HOTBM uses a polynomial approximation. It works well for functions
which are regular enough (in mathematical terms, they should be
defined and n-times continuously differentiable on the domain).

======================================================================

Version 0.4beta provides the following operators:
    LeftShifter, RightShifter, LZOC, IntAdder 
       building blocks of FP computing, pipelined
    FPLargeAcc
       An operator for efficient and accurate accumulation 
       of floating-point numbers, partly pipelined 
    IntConstMult, FPConstMult
       optimized constant multipliers in integer and FP flavor 
    IntMultiplier, FPMult 
       multipliers with automatic pipeline generation

In addition, this distribution provides the useful conversion tools 
fp2bin, bin2fp and longacc2fp.

There has been no extensive testing on these operators yet, use at your own risk. 

This is the first version with automatic pipeline generation, although
not all the operators support it.

The utopian objective is to have each operator built to
work at a user-specified frequency (option -frequency) on a
user-specified hardware target.

The sad reality is that currently, the only target is a Virtex 4. On other
chips (Altera or other Xilinx), you will get synthesisable VHDL, and
the pipeline will be deeper for higher frequencies, but it will not
necessarily be any close to the optimal. 
In the near future there will be a Stratix III target.




======================================================================
Version 0.1.1 was a proof of concept.
