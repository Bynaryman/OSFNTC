This file is for noting VHDL style issues (style that behaves bad in some simulators or synthesizers)


From Fabrizio Ferrandi

A problem with modelsim 10.1b: temporary aggregates are not well managed.
Currently, I've fixed only FPAdd Single and dual path in this part of the generated code:
  fracYfarXorOp <= fracYfar xor (55 downto 0 => EffSub); 
becomes
  EffSubVector <= (55 downto 0 => EffSub);
  fracYfarXorOp <= fracYfar xor EffSubVector;
