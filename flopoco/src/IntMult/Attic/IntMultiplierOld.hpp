			Corner cases that one has to understand and support:

			related to g, so stand-alone only: in general, g>0 when wOut<wX+wY.
			However, one situation where g=0 and wOut!=wX+wY is the tabulation of a small rounded multiplier.
			To manage this case, 1/ neededGuardBits should anticipate it and 2/ the rounding should always be at the bit 0 of the bit heap.



			Final rounding: to do only in case of a stand-alone operator. Therefore, it shouldn't be in fillBitHeap()


			Workflow for the stand-alone and virtual multipliers
			STAND-ALONE:
			inputs wOut, computes g out of it, computes lsbWeightInBitHeap, instantiates a bit heap, and throws bits in it.
			In case of truncation, needs to add a round bit

			VIRTUAL:
			inputs lsbWeightInBitHeap (which may have been computed by parentOp after calls to neededGuardBits) lsbFullMultWeightInBitheap
			and throws bits in it. No notion of guard bit: this belongs to parentOp.
			No addition of rounding bits: this is the responsibility of parentOp

		As a consequence, attributes of IntMultiplier:
			- there should be no global attribute g, because it is used only in the stand-alone case.
			- there should be no global attribute wOut, because it is used only in the stand-alone case.
			Actually there is a global attribute wOut, but to be used only by emulate()
			- fillBitHeap and the other methods should not refer to g or wOut
