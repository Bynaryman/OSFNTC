The attic directory is full of old stuff.

TODO short term: 
Finish (or rewrite) FixMultAdd. DONE
Probably need to add signed/unsigned IOs to IntMultiplier (?FixMultiplier?) -- prepare discussion
Add signed/unsigned support to the test framework (IO conversions from/to std_logic_vector).
Write FixPolynomialHornerEvaluator
Write FixFunctionByPiecewisePoly


TODO long term: manage non-uniform errors; manage non-uniform segmentation; something for sin(sqrt(x))


FixFunction
    Centralizes Sollya parsing and evaluation to various formats, including an emulate() that works for all FixFunctionBy*

FixFunctionByTable: a flopoco operator that is the most basic implementation of a FixFunction


BasicPolyApprox: mostly Sollya stuff to compute optimal coeff sizes, the machine-efficient polynomials.
DONE


PiecewisePolyApprox: Iterates over the previous to build a regular piecewise polynomial approximation. Roughly the approximation part of previous FunctionEvaluator
DONE



FixPolynomialHornerEvaluator: 
  constructor inputs alpha,  a table of 2^alpha vectors of coefficients, lsbY
  and builds table + horner evaluator (operator inputting index and Y)

			evaluates the corresponding polynomial(s) with truncated multipliers.
								REM a trunc mult faithful to lsb will compute weights to LSB+g 



FixFunctionBySimplePoly: a flopoco operator plugging  BasicPolyApprox to FixPolynomialHornerEvaluator


FixFunctionBySimpleBitHeap: an Operator plugging BasicPolyApprox to a bit heap back-end.
													 (with bit heaps you don't do piecewise polynomials, or you do it the HOTBM way)


FixFunctionByPiecewisePoly:
								the flopoco operator corresponding to the previous FunctionEvaluator
								It plugs PiecewisePolyApprox to FixPolynomialHornerEvaluator


				
GenericEvaluator:
	A wrapper class written by Sylvain that should be able to instantiate any of the others.
	Still in the src but currently disabled, and to be renamed.
