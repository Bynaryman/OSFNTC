	 These two positions are included: the size of the signal is wMSB-wLSB+1.
	 If signed, the sign bit, in position wMSB, has weight -2^wMSB. 

	 We can have a positive constant in a signed Fixconstant object, just as we can have leading zeroes.

	 By default the constructor has to provide MSB and LSB.
