This directory contains everything related to integer addition.
Specifically, (currently moved to the Attic)
- work related to pipelined adders of reasonable size
	(IntAdderClassical, IntAdderAlternative, IntAdderShortLatency)
- work related to fast adder structures for very large adders
	(all the others)

All this is documented in Pasca's papers below:

Pipelined FPGA adders. 
In Field-Programmable Logic and Applications, pages 422-427, 2010.
