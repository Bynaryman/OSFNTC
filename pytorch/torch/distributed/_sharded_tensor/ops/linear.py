def sharded_linear(types, args, kwargs, pg):
    """
    Handles ``__torch_function__`` dispatch for ``torch.nn.functional.linear``.
    This method computes a sharded linear and has the following limitations:

    1. Supports only sharding of ``weight``.
    2. Supports only ``ChunkShardingSpec``.
    3. Supports only a single local shard per rank.

    Based on the dimension that the weight is sharded on, there are two
    algorithms:

    ROWWISE SHARDING
    ================
    For row-wise sharding the weight is sharded on dimension 1, but this is
    row-wise since the actual computation for the linear layer involves
    transposing the weight: :math:`y = xA^T + b`

    The overall algorithm can be best explained with an example. Let's assume
    the dims for x are (13 x 16) and A are (17 x 16) and A is sharded across
    4 GPUs creating shards of (17 x 4). The algorithm is as follows:

    1. First the input is split on the column dimension to create shards of
       (13 x 4) and communicated to all other ranks. Since we are running in
       an SPMD mode with each rank having distinct input, this is done via
       an all2all run on all ranks.
    2. Now each (13 x 4) shard on each GPU is multiplied with the local shard
       (4 x 17) (transposed) resulting in a (13 x 17) matrix which is the same
       size that we need for the global result which would be (13 x 16)
       multiplied by (16 x 17). But the final result needs to be aggregated
       across the rest of the ranks.
    3. Now the local matmul results are aggregated and shared to all the
       corresponding ranks using a reduce_scatter operation ensuring each rank
       aggregates its own result. This is essentially a sum operation across
       all the (13 x 17) local computations we did for each rank.
    4. Finally, we add the bias term locally to the final computation.

    COLWISE SHARDING
    ================
    For col-wise sharding the weight is sharded on dimension 0, but this is
    col-wise since the actual computation for the linear layer involves
    transposing the weight: :math:`y = xA^T + b`

    The overall algorithm can be best explained with an example. Let's assume
    the dims for x are (13 x 17) and A are (16 x 17) and A is sharded across
    4 GPUs creating shards of (4 x 17). The algorithm is as follows:

    1. First the input is broadcasted to all ranks, since this is SPMD we
       actually do an all_gather for all the inputs resulting in 4 (13 x 17)
       inputs on each rank.
    2. Next we perform local matmuls by multiplying each input (13 x 17)
       with the local shard (17 x 4) (transposed). This results in 4 (13 x 4)
       matrices on each rank.
    3. Next, we concat these 4 matrices and perform an all2all to share the
       appropriate (13 x 4) matrices to each rank.
    4. Now, each rank receives a (13 x 16) matrix which is basically the size
       of the result we need.
    5. If placements are not in order any appropriate rearrangement of rows
       are done for the (13 x 16) matrix and finally the bias term is added.
