# OC-Accel actions

This subdirectory contains action examples and actions created by users. Each example consists of an application (in C) running on the host and an associated action (in Verilog/VHDL or in C/C++) being executed on the FPGA.

Check <https://opencapi.github.io/oc-accel/> for more information.

# Notes
One should add its action in subdirs of the Makefile if the folder does not start by hdl/hls.
