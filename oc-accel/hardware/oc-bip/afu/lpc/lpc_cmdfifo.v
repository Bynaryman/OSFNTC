// Title    : lpc_cmdfifo.v
// Function : This file contains a command buffer FIFO to "pre-fetch" a number of commands from the TLX.
//            More importantly, the command at the head of the FIFO can be presented and held for any number
//            of cycles. This differs from the TLX interface where the command is only valid for one cycle
//            (when cmd_valid=1) whether the AFU is ready to receive it or not. The AFU's command dispatch
//            logic may not be able to begin servicing the command immediately, depending on the command type
//            and current state of response credits or pipelined operations in progress. Therefore this command
//            FIFO was added to provide this behavior. 
//
//            In addition, several commands are buffered up at once. This helps absorb latency cycles in the TLX,
//            measured from receipt of a cmd_credit to the presentation of the next command. It also allows for
//            a higher performing interface by enabling back to back operation of bulk memory operations if they 
//            are of the appropriate mix. In other words if all commands are 1 FLIT writes, there will likely be
//            a burst of commands started in the pipeline, then a break while the credit flow catches up. However
//            if the commands are a mix of reads and writes of various lengths, there will be natural pauses in
//            command stream while waiting for data and these pauses can be used to let the command FIFO fill up
//            again. 
//
//            The width of the FIFO is parameterized to make it easy to adjust to the number of TLX command
//            signals that are needed. The LPC does not support all OpenCAPI TL commands, so some of the TLX->AFU
//            interface signals are unused. Rather than capture them in the FIFO and discard them when dispatching,
//            resources can be conserved by ignoring them at the TLX interface. Thus the width of the FIFO is
//            variable to enable easy modifications as additional signals are used as functionality increases.
//
//            Note: The depth of the FIFO is fixed, but may need to be adjusted after performance feedback from 
//                  simulation is obtained.
